Here, we  visualize the top-1%, 2%, and 5% activations of some feature maps in the decoder of IA-FaceS. The visualization results are given in the subfolders. Filename "32-5%"  indicates that we visualize  top-5% activations of feature maps at ![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/__latex/a11ea46280669ac0bf8afdac4019d77f.svg#card=math&code=32%20%5Ctimes%2032&id=hhZn1)resolution.

We visulize some meaningful activations below:



We can find some activations corresponding to specific face components, e.g., eyes, mouth, but we cannot find activations corresponding to a single eye.
